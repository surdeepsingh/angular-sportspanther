# angular-sportspanther
A website for a sports analytics company - SportsPanther, built using AngularJS and Bootstrap3. It is built on Modern Business template from www.startbootstrap.com/modern-business

This is a sample application being built for practicing AngularJS, and maybe using it as the official website for the company in the future. To visit the company's current website, check it out at www.sportspanther.com

Suggestions and feedback are welcome. I'm a newbie in AngularJS and would love to hear from you!
